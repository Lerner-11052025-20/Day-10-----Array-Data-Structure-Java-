# Day-10-----Array-Data-Structure-Java-
Welcome to Day 10 of my Data Structures &amp; Algorithms (DSA) Fundamentals Series. This repository focuses on mastering the Array data structure using Java, which is the foundation of most other data structures.


🌟 Basic concepts of arrays

🔄 Array operations: insertion, deletion, traversal, updating

🔍 Common problems and solutions using arrays

🧪 Java code examples with explanations

✅ Goal: Strengthen my foundation in arrays as a key step toward mastering DSA.



📌 What You'll Find Here
📖 Conceptual Overview:
What is an Array?

Types of arrays (1D, 2D, Multidimensional)

Memory allocation and indexing

Static vs Dynamic arrays (with comparison to ArrayList)

⚙️ Core Operations Implemented:
Creating arrays

Traversal (with for, while, for-each loops)

Insertion at specific index

Deletion from an index

Searching (Linear and Binary Search)

Updating values

Sorting (basic sorting algorithms applied on arrays)

💻 Code Examples:
Well-commented Java implementations for each concept

Examples for different scenarios and edge cases

Test cases to validate functionality

🧠 Problem Solving Practice:
LeetCode-style problems involving arrays

Patterns like Two Pointer, Sliding Window, Prefix Sum

Real-world problem-solving techniques using arrays

🎯 Learning Goals
Build a strong foundation in array manipulation

Understand how arrays are handled in Java at the memory level

Prepare for common DSA interview questions involving arrays

Learn clean coding and best practices in Java

🚀 What's Next?
This is part of my 100 Days of DSA challenge. Next up: Day 11 - Strings in Java
